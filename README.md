## Hi, I'm Yauncai! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

Iâ€™m a software engineer currently studying towards a BSc in Computer Science @IU. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about how data, blockchain, and ethical technology can reshape industries and communities.

With experience in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Solidity, I love building solutions that are both meaningful and technically sound. Whether Iâ€™m collaborating on blockchain projects or mentoring youth through volunteering, Iâ€™m always driven by purpose and possibility.
